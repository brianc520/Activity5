<h1>My Favorite Type Of Music: By: Brian</h1>
<body style="background-color:beige;">
    <p> I enjoy hip-hop and rap, this type of music helps me to feel cool in a sense. Right now I am listening to Weston Estate which is a new group that I found recently. There songs help me to relax and have peace of mind when I am doing something.</p>

    <p> Weston Estate Bio: <br>

        Weston Estate wants the world to know that they are definitively “ya aunty’s favorite boy band.” Named in jest for an affluent neighborhood adjacent to their hometown of Cary, North Carolina, the lo-fi, alt band is an alluring anomaly. Members Srikar Nanduri (guitar), Manas Panchavati (vocals), Tanmay Joshi (vocals), Abhi Manhass (production, bass), and Marco Luka (vocals) are five best friends whose descriptions of each other range from “epicurean dumbass,” “nicest guy you’ll ever meet,” to “a Spongebob character.” All of Indian descent with the exception of Marco who is first generation Cuban-American, they’ve tapped into their cultural influences, eclectic range of personalities and individual tastes to carve out a new space entirely of their own.
